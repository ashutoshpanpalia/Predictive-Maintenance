# Predictive-Maintenance
Big Data analytics to categorize a pump into 3 categories and schedule maintenance.

DrivenData Pump it up: data mining the water table

My Approach:

Combine the data and use matlab for data preprocessing:

Pre-processing was done to reduce dimensionality.

Pandas dummy variable was used to convert categorical data.

Standard_scalar was used to scale all the data to[-1 , 1]

RandomForest algorithm was used after optimizing using GridSearchCV
