# Pump It Up: Data Mining for Water Pump Functionality in Tanzania
This repository documents my approach to the DrivenData challenge, "Pump It Up: Data Mining the Water Table". The goal of this competition was to predict the functionality (functional, needs repair, non-functional) of water pumps in Tanzania using provided data.

# Project Overview

## Competition: 
Pump It Up: Data Mining the Water Table (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/)

## Goal: 
Predict functionality of water pumps in Tanzania

## Data Source: 
Tanzanian water source data provided by DrivenData

# My Approach

## Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:

Combined training and testing data for preprocessing.

Reduced dimensionality using feature selection techniques.

Converted categorical data into numerical features using Pandas dummy encoding.
Standardized all features to a range of [-1, 1] using scikit-learn's StandardScaler.

## Model Development:

Employed a Random Forest classification algorithm for prediction.

Optimized hyperparameters using GridSearchCV to improve model performance.
Further Considerations

## Results:

Rank: 6602/16914 


# Next Steps

This repository will be further developed to include the following:
Code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.

# Libraries Used

Pandas

scikit-learn
